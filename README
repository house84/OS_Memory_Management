What this program does: 
-----------------------

	This program uses an OSS to simulate memory managing virtual memory (paging). This 
	program will generate up to 18 concurrent User process that will request to read 
	and write to an address within their alloted 32k frame. A memory address will be 
	generated by the User process with a request to read or write, it is currently set
	to call a Read operation 85% of the time. There is a small chance the requested 
	memory address will be outside the alloted memory space, in this case the user 
	process will be terminated by the OSS. Additionally the User will check if it should 
	terminate every 1000 +/- 100 memory references. 

	The OSS will manage users requests for memory and will manage system memory and swap
	as needed. OSS has a designated memory space of 256k designated into 1k pages. These
	addresses will be assigned to users as follows. If a new unallocated request OSS will
	check its bitVector for unallocated memory space, if available the user will be 
	allocated 1k of space. In the even all 256k of memory is allocated a First in first 
	out second chance algorithm will run and return the corresponding index for the new
	process to be allocated. The user process will be added to a faultQ and will be freed
	once 14ms has passed. Additionally any file that was swapped by FIFO will be checked 
	for dirty bit, if so additional time is added to the system clock. A daemon process 
	is checked every memory allcoation and is run if there is less than 10% free frames
	left, it will unset the validBit of the oldest 5% of frames. In the even the frame
	validBit is already false it will free that space and swap any dirtbit into memory
	with additional time cost. 

	This program tracks some statistics that is printed into the logfile and onto the 
	terminal. Everytime a user process terminates the effective access time for its life
	is calculated and displayed. Additionally stats 
	-Page Faults/Memory access
	-Memory Access/Seconds
	-Average Memory Access Speed
	-Number of Segfaults per memory access

How to use this program:
------------------------

	1) Execute Makefile

		$ make
	
	2) Execute oss program

		$ ./oss [-h][-d][-p n]

	USAGE: 
		
		-h 		Displays Help/Usage
		-d		Prints Debug Info to Terminal
		-p n	Specifies Number of Concurrent Users

Observations about this program:
--------------------------------

	Not a lot to add to this program other than it is quite complex. One observation is
	that the daemon process does a very good job of reducing page faults for FIFO calls.
	I expected to see more uses of the FIFO algorithm, but the Daemon process tends to 
	free space in memory quite reliably. 

	This project was great, a lot to learn and test using virtual memory paging concepts.
